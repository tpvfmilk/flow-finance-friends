## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### Responsive Layout Issues
- **Issue**: Sankey Chart didn't resize properly on smaller screens, causing chart overflow and poor node spacing
- **Root Cause**: Fixed chart dimensions and lack of responsive breakpoints
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented responsive configuration with mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
  - Added dynamic node width, padding, and margin adjustments based on screen size
  - Enhanced resize handler with ResizeObserver for better performance
  - Added responsive font sizing for optimal readability across devices
- **Result**: Chart now properly adapts to all screen sizes with appropriate node spacing
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/dashboard/sankey/SankeyChart.tsx`

#### Goal Tooltip Data Mismatch
- **Issue**: Goal tooltips showed incorrect "Saved So Far" amounts that didn't match Sankey flow values
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded goal progress data wasn't synchronized with actual remaining amounts
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `UNIFIED_GOAL_TARGETS` and `UNIFIED_GOAL_PROGRESS` constants
  - Calculated goal progress from actual remaining amounts after expenses
  - Updated goal nodes in Sankey to use actual flow amounts
  - Synchronized tooltip data with Category Breakdown calculations
- **Result**: Goal tooltips now show accurate progress matching Sankey flow amounts
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
  - `src/components/dashboard/sankey/SankeyChart.tsx`

#### Data Consistency Issues
- **Issue**: Sankey Chart and Category Breakdown showed different financial values due to separate mock data sources
- **Root Cause**: `getMockSankeyData()` and category/expense mock data were using different allocation and spending amounts
- **Solution**: 
  - Created unified `UNIFIED_ALLOCATIONS` and `UNIFIED_EXPENSES` constants
  - Updated all mock data functions to use consistent values
  - Modified Sankey tooltips to use the same data source as Category Breakdown
  - Balanced Sankey links to match total allocations from Category Breakdown
- **Result**: All dashboard components now display consistent financial information
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/lib/mock-data.ts`
  - `src/components/dashboard/sankey/SankeyChart.tsx`

  - Updated `getMockStats()` to calculate totals from unified data
  - Exported unified constants for cross-component usage
- **Sankey Data Synchronization**:
  - Restructured Sankey nodes to use consistent allocation amounts
  - Balanced contribution links to match total deposits
